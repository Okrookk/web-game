# Dungeon Dom

**A fast-paced, pixel-art co-op multiplayer dungeon shooter.**

Built using purely **DOM (Document Object Model) elements** for rendering, proving that you don't need a Canvas to make chaos happen.

## 🕹️ Game Mechanics

-   **Multiplayer Mayhem**: Support for 2-4 players in real-time.
-   **Combat**: Shoot fireballs to defeat skeletons & vampires.
-   **Survival**: Collect HP Flasks to heal and Hearts to gain extra lives.
-   **Progression**: Kill as much enemies as possible to top the leaderboard (or just have fun and survive as long as you can).
-   **Atmosphere**: Immerse yourself with pixel-art visuals and a complete soundscape (music, effects, and dynamic events).

## ⚠️ Browser Recommendation
